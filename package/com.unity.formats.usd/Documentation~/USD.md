# USD Experimental Package for Unity

This package includes a set of libraries designed to support the use of USD in C#, as well as code to import and export USD files into the editor. The goal of this package is to make it maximally easy to integrate and explore Universal Scene Description.

# Getting Started

## Requirements

* Windows / OSX (Intel only)
    * Apple Silicon architectures are not currently supported by this package. To use this package on M1 devices, you must use an x64 install of the Unity Editor.
* Unity version: 2019.4 and up

## Project Configuration

* The USD importer works with linear color space only. To ensure colors are imported correctly, ensure that the project color space is set to "linear" in Edit > Project Settings > Player:

* This package supports importing USD skinned meshes with unlimited bone weights per vertex. However, to see the effect of more than 4 weights per vertex, Unlimited Skin Weights must be enabled for Unity in the project settings under Edit > Project Settings > Quality:

## Installing the Package

To get started, install the USD package via the Unity Package Manager. You can do this by either:

* installing by name, "com.unity.formats.usd";

* installing by Git URL, "https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/usd-unity-sdk.git?path=package/com.unity.formats.usd";

* or browsing for a local package while working with source.

Once the USD package is installed, a USD menu will appear, enabling you to easily import and export USD files.

## Package Limitations

* The USD plugin bundles are not currently code signed, so will need to be manually signed or removed from standalone player builds.

* This package uses USD v20.08, so some of the functionality of newer USD versions may be missing.

## Samples

The USD package also includes samples to help you get started. Use the Package Manager Window to import the samples into your Assets folder. For each of the samples, open the scene file and inspect the relevant Game Object in the Inspector Window to get started.

Note that Samples will not work as expected when installed from Source. For a local package, you can open them directly from the project browser, in the Packages folder. If you are using a Git URL to install the package, the package will be in a readonly state and the Scene will not open. In this case, you will have to copy the Samples files into the project folder to use them.
