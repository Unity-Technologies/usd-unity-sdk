# USD Unity SDK: USD Experimental Package for Unity

This repository contains the source code for the `com.unity.formats.usd` package. It includes a set of libraries designed to support the use of USD in C#, as well as code to import and export USD files into the editor. The goal of this package is to make it maximally easy to integrate and explore Universal Scene Description.
